Java Collection framework::

COllection are containers that group multiple items in a single unit

It is an architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects

Using java collevtions various operations on the data like searching , sorting ,insertion, deletion etc

Java Collection framework provides many interfaces and classes.

COllection Framework Heirarchy
Iterable
Collection
LIst 		Queue 		Set
Arraylst	Deque		Hash set
linked list 	ArrayDeque	Linked HashSet
vector				Sorted set
Statck				Tree set
--------------------------------------
Interfaces

Interfaces are the reference types which are similar to classes but contains only abstract methods

Iterator - The iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements only in a forward direction.
methods- hasNext() next() remove()

Iterable - The Iterable is a root interface for all the collection classes. The collection interface along with all its subclasses also implement the iterable interface.
methods - Iterator<T> iterator()

Collection - COllection interface is implemented by all the collection framework & decalre the methods that every collection will contain.
methods - Boolean add(Object obj).

---------------------------------------
List 
List in an interface
list extends the COllection framework and stores elements in an indexed approach can contain duplicate values

List Types
ArrayList  - Array list is the implementation of List interface when the elements can be dynamically added or removed from list
methods - 
add(Collection c), 
add(int index, Object element),
Object[] toArray(), 
void clear(),
Object clone,
int lastIndexof(Object 0),
void trimToSize().


 
Linked LIst - Linked list is a sequence of links which contains items
Each link contains a connection to another item

types: 
Singly linked list

Each node in this list stores a data of the node and a reference to the next node in the list.
Doubly linked list 

DOubly linked list has two references one to the next node and one to the previous node

methods- add(),indexOf(),addFirst(),size(),remove(),remove(Object o)


Vector 
A synchronized thread safe version of arraylist.
Vector object = neew Vector(size,increment);
---------------------------------------
Queue

Queue is supposed to work as a FIFO approach .
Queue<Integer> = new LinkedList<>();
methods : add(),remove(),element(),peek(),poll(),offer().
---------------------------------------
Set

A set refers to a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements

It is maninly to model mathematical set abstraction

Set uses hashing techniques to store unique elements

Set classes :
HashSet
Java Hashset class creates a collection that use a hash table for storage 
Hashset only contain unique elements and it inherits the Abstract class and implements Set interface.
Uses Hashing mechanism that has a has method that creates an unique hash code for each element

Methods of Hash Set : add(),remove(),clone(),isEmpty(),contains(),size(),iterator(),clear().

LinkedHashSet

It is a Hasg table and linked list implementation of the set of interface.
LinkedHashSet<String> al = new LinkedHashSet(); 

TreeSet
It is a sorted version of the set
The objects in tree set are sorted in ascending order
TreeSet<String> al = new TreeSet<String>();
